# Apollo Workbench with Federation 2 Support

[Apollo Workbench](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apollographql.apollo-workbench) is a VS Code extension for designing and growing your federated schemas.

Once you've [installed Workbench](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apollographql.apollo-workbench) then a new Workbench icon will show up in your side tray.

Click the Apollo Workbench icon to browse all `.apollo-workbench` files in the open subfolders in VSCode Explorer.

This will show the following:

It works just like the previous version of Workbench, but there will be multiple enhancements:

- Federation 2 support!
- Federation 2 composition hints display in the problems tray with new hover tips.
- Most errors point at the exact position in the schema now :tada:
- Hovering over an ignored hint (3 dots) will display the reason and original message

Workbench pairs nicely with the [Apollo GraphQL for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apollographql.vscode-apollo) extension that provides syntax highlighting and much more!
